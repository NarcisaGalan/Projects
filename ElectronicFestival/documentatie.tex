 \textbf{Electronic Festival}\\
\end{Large}

\vspace{2cm}
The five biggest DJs in the world are going to play in an electronic music festival,each \newline one in a specific stage. They are side by side waiting to play. Find out their nationalities, hobbies and which genre they play.
\newline
\newline
Shirt: black, blue, green, red, white\newline
Stage: Arcadia, Asgard, Shangri­la, Valhalla, Xibalba\newline
Nationality: American, Canadian, Dutch, French,\newline
Scottish 
Age: 25 years, 30 years, 35 years, 40 years, 45 years\newline
Hobby: camping, juggling, painting, singing, surfing\newline
Genre: drum and bass, dubstep, EDM, house, trance\newline
\newline
We know that:
\newline
The Scottish is somewhere to the left of the DJ wearing the White shirt.\newline
At the fourth position is the DJ who is going to play on the Arcadia stage.\newline
The 30 years old DJ is at the first position.\newline
The DJ that plays EDM is exactly to the right of the Canadian.\newline
The one who likes Painting is next to the DJ who plays Dubstep.\newline
The DJ wearing the Black shirt is somewhere between the Scottish and the Dubstep player,\newline in that order.\newline
The French DJ is next to the one wearing the Blue shirt.\newline
At one of the ends is the DJ that likes Camping.\newline
The DJ who is going to play on the Asgard stage is wearing the Blue shirt.\newline
The one that likes Painting is somewhere between the DJ wearing Green and the DJ \newline wearing Blue, in that order.\newline
At the fifth position is the DJ who plays Drum and bass.\newline
At the middle is the DJ who is going to play on the Asgard stage.\newline
The one who plays Trance is next to the one who plays Dubstep.\newline
The Canadian is exactly to the left of the DJ who likes Juggling.\newline
The DJ whose hobby is Singing is exactly to the right of the DJ wearing the Black shirt.\newline
The DJ in his Mid thirties is next to the DJ who is into Juggling.\newline
The 40 years old DJ is at the fourth position.\newline
The 40 years old DJ is somewhere between the Dutch and the youngest DJ, in that order.\newline
The DJ wearing Blue is somewhere to the left of the DJ who is going to play on the \newline Xibalba stage.\newline
The one who enjoys Surfing is going to play on the Valhalla stage.\newline
The DJ wearing the Red shirt is somewhere to the right of the French.\newline

\begin{Large}
 \textbf{Implementation}\\
\end{Large}

As we need to write a huge amount of propositions to encode the available knowledge.\newline
First Order Logic (FOL in short) offers us some more operators, which allow a more\newline compact way of writting the same knowledge.\newline
We want to model this problem in FOL, then to ask Mace4 to find a model.We are going to \newline use several predicates of arity one,like:\newline \newline
right-dj(x,y) : this is a predicate that tell us that y is the left neighbor of x\newline
We know that the DJs are side by side, so we give to each one a position(0,1,2,3,4). I implemented the right neighbor assuming that the neighbor from the right has the \newline position of his neighbor from left plus one. \newline \newline
neighbors(x,y) : means that x and y are neighbors\newline
Two DJs are neighbors if their position is equal with the other position plus one.\newline \newline
one-end(x) : means that x is placed in one of the and(position 0 or 4)\newline\newline
somewhere-right(x,y) : means that y is placed somewhere in the right of y\newline
Y being somewhere in the right of y means that y's position is x's position plus 1,or plus 2,\newline or plus 3\newline \newline
between(x,y,z) : means that y is somewhere between x and z \newline
Y being somewhere in the middle of x and z means that x is somewhere in the left of y and z is somewhere in the right of y. For this i used the somewhere-right predicate.\newline \newline

\begin{Large}
 \textbf{Solution}\\
\end{Large}
\newline
I found this puzzle on brainzilla.com/zebra­puzzles. The advantage of this site was that \newline I was able to check if the model that mace4 is giving is correct.
